FlowSync enables you to simplify routine tasks and automate your daily operations with ease. With 7,000+ integrations and advanced automation features, FlowSync equips businesses with the tools to create efficient 
workflow-allowing computers to handle the tedious work while humans focus on what they do best.

## FlowSync  start guide
FlowSync automates workflows that connects your apps. Consists of a trigger, which is an event that starts a Flow,and  followed by one or more actions which are events that start after a trigger has occured.

# Why build a Flow?
Use flowSync to automate yor repetitive tasks without coding, saving you time from juggling through different apps and saves money. Wheather you want to automate a simple task, like sending yourself a
Slack message any time your form is filled, or build a more complex  automated system, like a sales lead management workflow, Flow can do just that for you.

# 1.How to build Flows
Use the app directory to browse apps and see all the triggers and actions available for each of the 7000+ apps on FlowSync. Starts from a trigger and followed by one or more actionsto tailor your workfow to your needs.

**You can build Flows by:**
- Using AI to hep you create your Flow.
- Using pre-built templates.
- Coping and pasting steps from another Flow.

##  Blank Flow
**You can also build from scratch** . In your FlowSync account, hover over the left side menu and click on **Create a Flow**

- **Set up your trigger**

The trigger is the event that starts a Flow.

**Example:** A trigger can be each time some one submits a form on your website

***Tips***:You can have only one trigger that initiates the automated workflow.

- **Add actions**

Actions are the events a flow performs after it is triggered.

**Example:** An action could be adding a new row to a Google sheet with the submitted credentials once a form is completed.

***When a flow runs***,each actions it completes counts as on task.

### Next Steps 
- Once yor flow is published, either by AI, pre-built templates or by coping and pasting from another automation, Flow will run your actions step(s) each time your tigger event occurs
- You can view logs of your activities,including data that goes in and out of each flow step, in the flow history.
  
# 2.Manage notifications when errors occurs
When errors occur in youe Flows, Flowsync will send notifications to your Flowsync account email address by default. You can change how frequently you receive notifications for all your Flows, as well as set custom frequencies for a particular app.

# 3.Can't Find the app you're looking for?
