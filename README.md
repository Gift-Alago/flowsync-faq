## ❓ What is FlowSync?

FlowSync enables you to simplify routine tasks and automate your daily operations with ease. With 7,000+ integrations and advanced automation features, FlowSync equips businesses with the tools to create efficient workflows—allowing computers to handle the tedious work while humans focus on what they do best.

---

## 🚀 FlowSync Start Guide

FlowSync automates workflows by connecting your apps. Each Flow consists of:
- A **trigger**: an event that starts the Flow
- One or more **actions**: events that happen after the trigger occurs

---

## 🤖 Why Build a Flow?

Use FlowSync to automate your repetitive tasks **without coding**—saving time and money.  
Whether you want to automate a simple task (like sending a Slack message when a form is submitted) or create a more complex system (like a sales lead management workflow), FlowSync can handle it.

---

## 1. How to Build Flows

Use the **App Directory** to browse apps and see all the triggers and actions available for each of the 7,000+ apps on FlowSync. Flows start from a trigger and are followed by one or more actions tailored to your workflow.

### You can build Flows by:
- Using **AI** to help you create your Flow
- Using **pre-built templates**
- **Copying and pasting steps** from another Flow

### 🛠 Blank Flow

You can also build from scratch.  
In your FlowSync account, hover over the left-side menu and click **Create a Flow**.

#### ➤ Set Up Your Trigger

The trigger is the event that starts a Flow.  
**Example:** Each time someone submits a form on your website.

> 💡 You can have only **one trigger** per Flow.

#### ➤ Add Actions

Actions are the tasks Flow performs after the trigger fires.  
**Example:** Adding a new row to a Google Sheet once a form is submitted.

> 🔄 Each action completed counts as **one task**.

### ✅ Next Steps
- Once your Flow is published—whether by AI, pre-built templates, or manual creation—FlowSync will run your action step(s) each time the trigger occurs.
- You can view activity logs, including input and output data, in the **Flow History** section.

---

## 2. Manage Notifications When Errors Occur

When errors happen in your Flows, FlowSync sends notifications to your FlowSync account email by default.  
You can:
- Change how frequently you receive notifications
- Set custom alert settings per app

---

## 3. Can’t Find the App You’re Looking For?

**Here are some alternatives to try:**

- If the app doesn’t have the action you need, create **custom actions** or **API Request actions**
- If the app isn’t available but supports **REST API**, use **webhooks** to connect it manually

---

## 4. Can I Schedule When a Flow Runs?

Yes! Use the **“Schedule” trigger** to run automations at specific times: daily, weekly, monthly, or custom intervals.  
Perfect for:
- Regular reporting
- Automated reminders
- Data syncing

---

## 5. What Happens When I Reach My Task Limit?

When you hit your monthly task limit:
- Your Flows stop running until the next billing cycle
- You’ll receive an email alert
- You can **purchase extra tasks** or **upgrade your plan**

---

## 6. How Do I Test My Flow Before Going Live?

Use **Test Mode** to simulate your Flow steps:
- Preview data at each stage
- Catch issues early with clear error indicators
- Make sure everything works before publishing
- Once you are done running in test mode you click **publish** on the left side corner of the screen

---

## 7. Can I Collaborate with My Team?

Yes—if you're on the **Team** or **Enterprise** plan!

Features include:
- Inviting teammates
- Setting user roles and permissions
- Sharing Flows in a shared workspace

---

## 8. Does FlowSync Support Conditional Logic?

Absolutely! FlowSync supports **If/Else** conditions to handle dynamic logic.

**Example:**  
"If the customer is tagged as 'VIP', send an alert to Sales. Otherwise, just log it in Google Sheets."
